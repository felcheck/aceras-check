# Agent Directory

Use this file with `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` to keep personas in sync across Claude and Codex sessions.

## References
- Workflow rules: `AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`
- Instruction overlay: `CLAUDE.md`
- Personas: `.agents/`

## Personas
- **Planner** – `.agents/planner.md`
- **Developer** – `.agents/developer.md`
- **Reviewer** – `.agents/reviewer.md`

## How to Work
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` + the relevant plan under `thoughts/plans/`.
2. Choose a persona above and follow its `.agents/*.md` guidance.
3. Log progress / findings back into the active plan or `thoughts/research/` / `thoughts/issues/` as appropriate.
